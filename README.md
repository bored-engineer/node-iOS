node-iOS
========
### Allows javascript access to iOS functionality (vibrate, accelerometer, etc.) 

This module offers javascript access to Apple iOS functionality, meant for `node`
running on an Apple iDevice. 

I'm always looking for ideas for additional APIs to add. So if you can think of any
functionality that you want exposed to JavaScript that's missing from the API,
then please don't hesitate to open an [Issue](https://github.com/innoying/node-iOS/issues)
requesting it!

You can install it via `npm install node-iOS`


Note: This was inspired by TooTallNate's [node-iOS](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-iOS) which no longer compiles.
